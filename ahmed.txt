// todo
*we need to automatically iterate the process + make sure it is correct in the first place
+ mutation + add a condition the one that lives longer gets score of 5 every 4 seconds
*local storage issue (it saves it as layers only not as a an instance of a class)
*make the input layer from the layers
*make sensors + detection for sensors + define gaming over for network;
*button to activate the network
*each cannon should have it own generator and its own sensors

//viualization
* build the visualization
* build the network itself

//  
* add sensors ()




// network todo
* build the network
* cannon will end up throwing bullets till the ninja disappear (which means +1 then -1)

//network issues
*make the model make the decision of moving to right and then increase the angle according to that
*you need the model to be able to know the tip of the cannon;

I should give the network a sign that hitting a ninja is five times better than missing a bullet










//knowledge
* beginPath is when you want to draw like lineTo moveTo arc
* save() and restore() when you want to isolate some drawings environment
